# Mostpaster (codename postmaster-better)

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

A New Zealand parcel tracking application built upon an API proxy.
Production build is [available here](https://mostpaster.vercel.app).

## Notes
- this is just a beta basically
- expect bugs, web dev is hard
- desktop uses mobile UI
- no image support yet

## Known bugs
- "add new tracker" bottom sheet is kinda buggy in chrome, but works fine in pwa, or just use gboard next button
- delete gesture can get stuck sometimes, I was too lazy to fix this, just swipe again
- delete gesture broken on desktop
- service worker to auto refresh may not work as expected
- notification service is dead
- mobile icon is low res as fuck
- install screen got.. cool screenshots
- home screen scroll is kinda hard rn (same)
